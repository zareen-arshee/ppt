# Detailed functional components & metrics for RAM — Solar, Wind, and BESS

Below is a granular, implementation-ready catalog grouped by **Common**, **Solar**, **Wind**, **BESS**, and **AI/ML** components.
Each row shows: **Component / Metric → Applicable asset(s) → Purpose / Description → Key metrics / parameters → Primary data source → Derived formula (when applicable) → Notes / dependencies**.

> Tip: you can copy these tables into Excel/Jira to turn rows into epics/tasks. If you want, I can next map each component to **Workstream** (Algorithms / BFF / ETL / Reports / UI) automatically.
