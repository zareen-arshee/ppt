| **Visual Component** | **KPI**                             | **Description**                                                                                                                          | **Unit** | **Raw Data Required**                                                           | **Calculation Logic**                                                     | **Analytics Granularity**       | **Benefit**                                                                                                   |

| **KPI**              | **Grid Availability**               | Measures the percentage of time the grid is available to evacuate power from the plant (no grid outage or maintenance downtime).         | %        | Grid status signal (ON/OFF), SCADA event logs, time duration data               | (Total Time − Grid Downtime) / Total Time × 100                           | Daily / Monthly / Yearly        | Identifies energy loss due to grid outages; supports utility coordination and energy forecasting.             |
| **KPI**              | **Plant Availability**              | Indicates the percentage of time the plant and its equipment (inverters, transformers, etc.) are available for power generation.         | %        | Equipment availability logs, SCADA alarms, inverter run status                  | (Total Time − Plant Downtime) / Total Time × 100                          | Daily / Weekly / Monthly        | Measures operational uptime, helps assess O&M performance and equipment reliability.                          |
| **KPI**              | **Inverter Performance Ratio (PR)** | Evaluates the efficiency and performance of the inverter by comparing its actual output to theoretical output based on solar irradiance. | %        | Inverter energy output, irradiance (GHI/POA), installed DC capacity             | (Actual Inverter Output Energy ÷ (Irradiance × DC Capacity × Time)) × 100 | Inverter / String / Plant Level | Highlights inverter efficiency; identifies underperforming inverters for maintenance.                         |
| **KPI**              | **Plant Load Factor (PLF)**         | Represents how effectively the plant capacity is being utilized over a given period.                                                     | %        | Total energy exported to grid, plant rated capacity, time period                | (Actual Energy Exported ÷ (Installed Capacity × Total Hours)) × 100       | Monthly / Yearly                | Helps evaluate overall plant utilization; critical for financial and regulatory performance tracking.         |
| **KPI**              | **Plant Availability Factor (PAF)** | Shows the proportion of plant capacity available for generation, factoring in outages and deratings.                                     | %        | Equipment status (available/unavailable), rated capacity, derated capacity logs | (Available Capacity ÷ Installed Capacity) × 100                           | Daily / Monthly                 | Reflects operational readiness of the plant; useful for SLAs, tariff claims, and performance-based contracts. |

Would you like me to **extend this table** with **derived KPIs** (like Energy Loss due to Grid Unavailability, Specific Yield, or CUF) next — to make the KPI layer more exhaustive for Solar?
