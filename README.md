| **KPI**              | **Grid Availability**               | Percentage of time the grid was available to evacuate power from the plant (i.e., not under grid outage or curtailment).                       | %        | Grid status logs, timestamped SCADA data (grid on/off), duration of grid downtime | ( \text{Grid Availability} = \frac{\text{Total Time} - \text{Grid Downtime}}{\text{Total Time}} \times 100 )                            | Correlate with generation loss due to external grid unavailability    | Site / Plant / Portfolio | Identifies energy loss due to grid outages and supports SLA & performance contracts          |
| **KPI**              | **Plant Availability**              | Measures the percentage of time the plant was operational and capable of producing energy (excluding grid unavailability).                     | %        | Equipment status (inverter, transformer, breaker), SCADA plant logs               | ( \text{Plant Availability} = \frac{\text{Total Time} - \text{Plant Downtime}}{\text{Total Time}} \times 100 )                          | Used for operational benchmarking and O&M performance                 | Plant / Site             | Evaluates overall operational uptime and maintenance effectiveness                           |
| **KPI**              | **Inverter Performance Ratio (PR)** | Efficiency ratio comparing actual energy generated by inverter to theoretically expected energy based on irradiance and installed DC capacity. | %        | Inverter AC energy output, Irradiance (W/m²), Installed DC capacity (kWp)         | ( \text{PR}_{inv} = \frac{\text{Actual Energy}}{\text{Irradiance (kWh/m²)} \times \text{Installed DC (kWp)}} \times 100 )               | Detects inverter underperformance and localized energy losses         | Inverter / String        | Identifies weak inverters, soiling or shading impacts, and helps optimize inverter-level O&M |
| **KPI**              | **Plant Load Factor (PLF)**         | Ratio of actual energy generated over a period to the maximum possible energy if the plant operated at full capacity continuously.             | %        | Energy generated (MWh), Installed capacity (MW), Time (hours)                     | ( \text{PLF} = \frac{\text{Actual Energy Generated}}{\text{Installed Capacity} \times \text{Total Hours}} \times 100 )                  | Benchmark long-term utilization of plant capacity                     | Plant / Portfolio        | Indicates how efficiently the installed capacity is being utilized throughout the year       |
| **KPI**              | **Plant Availability Factor (PAF)** | Similar to plant availability but considers the capacity-weighted availability for generation capability.                                      | %        | Available capacity (MW), Installed capacity (MW), Time duration                   | ( \text{PAF} = \frac{\text{Sum of Available Capacity (MW·h)}}{\text{Installed Capacity (MW)} \times \text{Total Time (h)}} \times 100 ) | Used for contractual performance and power purchase agreements (PPAs) | Plant / Fleet            | Ensures contractual compliance and helps evaluate readiness to deliver expected generation   |
